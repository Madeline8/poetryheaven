            <p>When: Saturday 23 April 2022, 11:00 am - 1:00 pm </p><br>
            <p>The Poetry Heaven's Cafe Young Poets Takeovers are a space for up-and-coming young poets and performers
                to meet one another and share their work on stage. If you want to hear from the up-and-coming stars of
                the poetry world, come along!</p><br>

            <p> This Takeover will be hosted by Dale Booton, and feature headline sets from former Birmingham Young Poet
                Laureate Aliyah Begum and award-winning young poet Tom Rowe. Tickets are totally free!</p><br>

            <p>If you are aged 25 or younger, we want to hear from you, too! Bring one poem and arrive from 10:30am to
                sign up for our open mic. We welcome all styles of poetry, and writers at all stages in their
                development. It is first come, first served and open mic slots are popular, so arrive promptly to get
                your name on the list. </p><br>


            <p> Of course, you don't have to perform to come along. We'd love to see all young poets and poetry fans
                there and we want to welcome you into our Young Poets Network community! We invite you to stay on
                afterwards for free refreshments and a chance to meet other young poetry lovers.</p><br>
