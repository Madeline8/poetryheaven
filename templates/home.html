                        Your ideas and creativity grow as you grow. For instance, when you were a teenager perhaps you
                        weren't interest in writing. Years later, you are now participating in poetry contests. This is
                        just to show you that when you start writing poems, you might not be at your best but as you
                        keep writing, eventually, you become more creative. Through creativity you will be able to
                        provide your writers with amazing content.

                    <p class="center-align grey-text text-darken-2">
                        When you are a beginner in writing your poems, you probably just do it to satisfy your own needs
                        or even as a hobby. What you forget is when you present your work to poetry contests, it
                        attracts new readers on a daily basis. This will get you feedback and reviews. Basically, you
                        will be able to make new friends. Whether they will be your readers or your fellow contestants,
                        you will get to connect with new people and these connections might go a long way to helping you
                        in the future.

                        As you write your poems on a daily basis, you get to practice another important skill that you
                        may not be aware of. You sometimes express your emotions and this is a good thing. You get to
                        learn how to do it with ease and eventually, that will help you in ways you cannot imagine. You
                        might even release your anger and emotional pain by writing these poems that will be used in
                        poetry competitions. Basically, poetry is an amazing therapeutic way of self expression that
                        leads to healing.

                        Self-awareness and Language skills

                        How often do you listen to yourself? Through poetry writing, you are able to have a look at what
                        you wrote and this could be a direct reflection of yourself. This means that you will not find
                        self awareness as a foreign thing since you do it through poetry. As you develop your self
                        awareness skills, you also develop your language skills. The truth about poetry is that every
                        time you write a poem, it needs to sound original and unique from the other pieces you have
                        written in the past. This is very essential if you have readers who read your poems on a regular
                        basis. You wouldn't want your audience to be reading the same thing every now and then. Poem
                        readers need to feel connected to your poems and this can only happen if your language and
                        writing skills are amazing.
